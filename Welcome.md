Welcome,

You have safely landed to the Nuxeo Platform Codenvy quick-start template! Compared to an empty Java Codenvy project, you have:

- a sample operation from which you get inspiration to implement your own operations (see [about automation]( http://doc.nuxeo.com/x/mQAz) and [how to build an operation](http://doc.nuxeo.com/x/7QAz))
- a custom runner (see runner menu) "nuxeo" that will build and deploy your java project on a Nuxeo Platform instance started in the cloud,
In the future we will add the ability to easily "deploy" a Nuxeo Studio Project, necessary for implementing the business logic of your project. You can get a Nuxeo Studio access filling the [this form](https://connect.nuxeo.com/register).
